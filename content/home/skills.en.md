I am a Software Developer passionate about creating high performance solutions
that take the most advantage they can from the hardware they use. I always code
following the best standards, verifying the code quality with analysis tools
and automated tests. I am a huge fan of maths, process automation, distributed
computing and Open Source.

Currently my main programming language is Go, I have been coding with it since
July 2018 in personal projects. It is my favorite programming language so far.
I can build libraries, CLIs, APIs, services, full applications and probably
anything you need with it.

I coded with Python and JavaScript (Node.js) in the past. I also finished the
42 C Piscine in Silicon Valley, so I have basic knowledge of C.

As a Frontend Web Developer I can build websites and web applications for you,
using modern and lightweight technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Hugo,
Bulma, Alpine.js, etc...

I can also architect and administrate your infrastructure, from bare metal
servers to Cloud Providers, or even hybrid environments. I have proficiency
with Linux, Shell Scripting, IaC, containers and orchestration.
