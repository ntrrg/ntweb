I am a Software Developer passionate about creating high performance solutions
that take the most advantage they can from the hardware they use. I always code
following the best standards, verifying the code quality with analysis tools
and automated tests. I am a huge fan of maths, problem solving, distributed
computing and Open Source.

Currently my main programming language is Zig. It is my favorite programming
language so far. I can build libraries, CLIs, APIs, services, full
applications and probably anything I need.

I know how to code with Go, Python and JavaScript. I also finished the 42 C
Piscine in Silicon Valley, so I have basic knowledge of C.

As a Frontend Web Developer I can build websites and web applications for you,
using modern and lightweight technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Astro,
Tailwind, Svelte, WASM (with Zig), etc...

I can also architect and administrate infrastructure, from bare metal servers
to Cloud Providers, or even hybrid environments. I have proficiency with Linux,
Shell Scripting, containers and orchestration.

Here is my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dbXk7CYAAG_MefJ4i5bddwkH6z9esE-y-NjpB1_PGdQ/edit?usp=sharing) ([PDF](/en/cv.pdf))
